  Actively design, build, and expand a Proxmox VE home lab to replicate enterprise IT and cybersecurity environments for continuous hands-on learning.Configure and maintain virtual machines, storage, and network bridges, ensuring realistic simulations of production-level infrastructure.Continuously deploy and test systems such as Windows Server, Windows 11, Linux distributions, pfSense, and Security Onion to strengthen skills in virtualization, system administration, and security monitoring.

Experiment with network segmentation, firewalls, and intrusion detection tools to gain practical experience in defending and troubleshooting complex environments.

Regularly refine the lab by adding new configurations, testing security scenarios, and applying updates to reflect current industry practices.

Leverage the lab as a safe space to explore incident response, vulnerability management, and system hardening techniques, while improving technical proficiency in both IT operations and cybersecurity. 

 Configured firewall rules within pfSense to control network traffic flow, ensuring proper segmentation, security, and access between virtualized environments. This included creating and testing inbound and outbound rules, NAT rules, and VLAN-based policies to simulate enterprise-level security practices.
